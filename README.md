This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) tasks for the third semester, implemented as part of my coursework. It is a structured collection of data structure implementations in C++, designed to help me (and others) thoroughly understand how these fundamental structures work from first principles.

🧠 What’s Inside

The current contents focus on core data structure tasks typically covered in a semester‑long DSA course:

Singly Linked List
(More structures will be added with future tasks)

Each implementation is meant to reinforce key concepts such as dynamic memory, pointer manipulation, traversal, insertion, deletion, and basic operations.

🎯 Why This Repo Exists

To learn and practice data structures by building them from scratch

To serve as a reference for coursework and technical interviews

To demonstrate understanding of the internal mechanics of fundamental structures

To grow into a larger library of implementations as tasks expand

📂 Repository Structure
/
├── Singly_Linked_List/     # Implementation and tasks for singly linked lists
├── README.md               # This documentation


Each folder contains the source files and task notes related to that particular data structure.

🚀 How to Use

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/AnasRashid5/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms_Tasks_3rd_Semester.git


Navigate to the specific task folder (for example Singly_Linked_List)

Study, compile, and run the implementation files

Use this repo as a study guide and base for building more structures

📈 Goals for Future Work

Add more data structures:
Stacks, Queues, Doubly Linked Lists, Trees, HashMaps, Graphs, etc.

Improve documentation and explanations per task

Include test cases and example usage

Add algorithm tasks alongside data structures

🧩 What You’ll Learn

By exploring and expanding this repository, you’ll reinforce:

Abstract Data Types and their implementations

Memory management and pointers (in C++)

Time and space complexity of operations

Internal mechanics of common structures
